Option to restart the game
Simple and user-friendly interface
Technologies:

Java
GUI libraries such as JavaSwing
Expected Outcomes:

A functional Tic Tac Toe game that can be played by two players
Improved understanding of object-oriented programming concepts
Hands-on experience in GUI development and game logic implementation
